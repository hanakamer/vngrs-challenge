To start the project you have to install the dependencies for the app by running:
```
npm install
```
command in the directory where package.json file is placed.

This will create a directory named 'node_modules' containing the dependencies.

To start the server where the app will work you should run:
```
npm run start
```
command in the directory where webpack.config file is placed.
